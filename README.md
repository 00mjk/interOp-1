# interOp
interOp is built to be a micro-service framework built for programming languages. The goal is anyone can write in any number of different languages in the same file and it will run micro-services to processes and recombine as one cohesive program.

## Requirements 
Windows Only
The only requirement is the R programming language. The others are optional.<br>
It is a requirement (with the exception of the R language) that all programming languages be in your ```%PATH%```. (Whenever installing a new language, there is always an option to add it to the path).

node.js:

R:

python:

lua:

GO:

Elixir: https://repo.hex.pm/elixir-websetup.exe <br>
Rust : https://win.rustup.rs/ <br>
## Language Support
Other Versions of the langauges work, these are just the tested versions

| Python|3.7.0 | X | X | X |  
| R |3.5.0| X | X | X | 
| node js |8.11.3| X | X  |  |
| lua |v5.1.5-52| X | X | |
| Go |1.10.3| X | X |  |

## Syntax 
Every interop document has to start with a tag, something like ```#Yourname#```. What is inside of the ```#â€™s``` do not matter.
### Code Markdown & Modules
To create a new code markdown in a given language, type ```**``` then the language name. For example if I was writing in ```js``` I would write ```**js```. To signify the end of a code module use ```**/```. Each module needs a name (written above) in order to run and be called, to signify the name of a module, write its name above the language declaration. For example:
```
moduleFun 
**js
Var x = 2;
Console.log(x);
**/
```
One can create multiple modules in any language in any order.
## Running Modules
To run a module simply type ```** moduleName```. It is important to note, the module will not run on initiation, and will not run if there is a missing space between ```**``` and the module name.
  ### Module Arguments
  To pass a module an argument simply do: ``` ** moduleName arg```
  ### Pipe Operators 
  The pipe operator is ```**<<```. To input the output of one module into another is straight forward. To input ```mod1``` into ```mod2``` simply write: ```mod1 **<< mod2```. So far this is not supported with all languages. 
## Compiling InterOp
For now, simply run the batfile: ```interOp.bat``` from cmd. The interpreter only reads from one file ```mainscript.txt```.
#### From R:
You can also run the ```interpreter.R``` file to process the code. If you want to run it in a live R enviorment, simply load ```interpreter.R``` and then run ```master()``` to re-run code.
