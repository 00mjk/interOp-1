# interOp
interOp is built to be a micro-service framework built for programming languages. The goal is anyone can write in any number of different languages in the same file and it will run micro-services to processes and recombine as one cohesive program.
## NOTE
This is still in development and only supports python, js and R.
## Requirements 
Only supported by windows.

The only requirement is the R programming language. The others are optional.<br>
node.js:
https://nodejs.org/en/download/ <br>
R:
https://cloud.r-project.org/ <br>
python:
https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/
## Syntax 
Every interop document has to start with a tag, something like ```#Yourname#```. What is inside of the ```#â€™s``` do not matter.
### Code Markdown & Modules
To create a new code markdown in a given language, type ```**``` then the language name. For example if I was writing in ```js``` I would write ```**js```. To signify the end of a code module use ```**/```. Each module needs a name in order to run and be called, to signify the name of a module, write its name above the language declaration. For example:
```
moduleFun 
**js
Var x = 2;
Console.log(x);
**/
```
One can create multiple modules in any language in any order.
## Pipe Operators 
The pipe operator is ```**<<```. To input the output of one module into another is straight forward. To input ```mod1``` into ```mod2``` simply write: ```**<< mod1 mod2```. So far this is not supported with all languages.
