# Installation 
## Requirements
Unix or Windows (preferred) <br><br>
For Linux specific installation see this page: https://github.com/hsamuelson/interOp/blob/master/documentation/linux.md <br>
The easiest set-up method is to download the newest binary from the Releases page. Otherwise it will be necessary for you to point the main interpreter to your own version of R.
## Download and Install Languages
It is a requirement for all languages (with the exception of the R) that they be in your %PATH%. (Whenever installing a new language, there is always an option to add it to the path). <br><br>
If the languages are not added to your path, you must change the default path in ```paths.csv``` to the correct path for the main executable. If the language is already added to the path, it's path in ```paths.csv``` should be the name of the language, for example ```python```.
