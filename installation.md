# Installation 
## Requirements
Windows Only <br>
The only requirement is the R programming language. The others are optional. Simply install your desired languages.
## Download and Install Languages
It is a requirement (with the exception of the R language) that all programming languages be in your %PATH%. (Whenever installing a new language, there is always an option to add it to the path).
